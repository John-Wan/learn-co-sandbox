# Hello, "My name is Arel."
# Each badge should read: "Hello, my name is _____."

# Hint: Remember that the return value of the each method is the original array that you are calling it on. How can you collect or store the room assignment strings you are creating as you iterate and return them at the end of your assign_rooms method? Google or use Ruby Docs to find the correct method.
