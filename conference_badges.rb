# Hello, "My name is Arel."
# Each badge should read: "Hello, my name is _____."

# Write a batch_badge_creator method that takes an array of names as an argument and returns an array of badge messages.

# Hint: Remember that the return value of the each method is the original array that you are calling it on. How can you collect or store the room assignment strings you are creating as you iterate and return them at the end of your assign_rooms method? Google or use Ruby Docs to find the correct method.
assign_rooms
assign_rooms[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
# return a list of room assignments in the form of: "Hello, _____! You'll be assigned to room _____!"
def add_prefix(assign_rooms)
  return "Hello[badge_maker]!  You'll be assigned to room [assign_rooms]"
end
  # printer
  # Create a method called printer that will output first the results of the batch_badge_creator method and then of the assign_rooms method to the screen.
  # Hint: Remember that methods can call other methods. If the return value of assign_rooms is an array of room assignments, how can you print out each assignment? You'll need to iterate over your array of room assignments in order to puts out each individual assignment.
